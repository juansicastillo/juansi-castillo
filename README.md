**Who Am I?**
</div>

<div align="justify">

I am an **Intermediate Pentester and Cybersecurity Enthusiast**, continuously developing my skills in offensive security and vulnerability analysis. Currently, I am not working, but I dedicate my time to **intensive practice**, **hands-on labs**, and **constant learning** to strengthen my technical foundation and move toward a professional career in cybersecurity.

My main focus is on **penetration testing**, **web vulnerability analysis**, and understanding attacker methodologies to improve system security. I am passionate about identifying weaknesses, analyzing exploitation techniques, and learning how to properly mitigate security risks in real-world environments.

In addition, I program in `Python`, which I use to create **custom scripts**, automate tasks, and develop small security tools to enhance my workflow. Combining programming with cybersecurity allows me to approach problems with a structured and technical mindset.

My goal is to keep improving every day, gain real-world experience, and become a highly skilled **Cybersecurity Professional**, capable of protecting systems and building secure digital environments.
